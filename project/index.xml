      <description>Classical molecular dynamics simulations are widely used to model biomolecular systems for drug design, protein structure determination, and biophysics research in general. In classical molecular dynamics, the movement of the atoms and molecules is obtained by numerically integrating Newton’s equations of motion as a function of time. The reliability of such simulations is dependent on the accuracy of the model used to describe the forces acting on the atoms. These models are commonly referred to as “force fields”.</description>

      <description>The optical and electronic properties of organic semiconductor thin films are intimately coupled to their morphology at the atomic level. Atomic level morphology cannot be probed experimentally. However, molecular simulations can provide a means to examine the morphologies of thin films with unrivalled spatial resolution. By directly mimicking the process by which organic semiconductor thin films are produced experimentally using either solution or vacuum processing, we have generated realistic morphologies for both organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).</description>
